### Overview

#### Introduction

This document provides guidelines for using iTELL. As a test case, we cover the iTELL adaptation of Introduction to Computing. The textbook was redesigned into an interactive web version by a team comprising a subject matter expert, a content and assessment developer, a multimedia and web developer, and an instructional designer from Georgia Tech.

### 2. How to Use iTELL

#### Modules, Chapters, and Sections

iTELL's content can be divided into Modules, Chapters, and Sections. You can access different Modules and Chapters using the navigation bar at the top. This book is divided into five different sections.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide7.png">
  You can access different Modules and Chapters using the navigation bar at the
  top.
</Image>

Clicking on a _Chapter_ button will lead you to the first section of the Chapter. Below is an overview of what a Section in an iTELL book looks like.

</Image>

(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) The progress bar (in (<span style= {{ color: '#60a5fa' }}>**blue**</span>)) shows how far you have scrolled down the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**2**</span>) The left-side navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Sections within the Module.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**3**</span>) Click on this quick link to move to the bottom of the page where the Summary-writing textbox is located.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**4**</span>) Click on this quicklink to move to the top of the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**5**</span>) The right-side navigation bar will have quick links to different subsections within the Section.

#### Making Progress

In most pages, you will be asked to **1)** answer constructed response items and **2)** write a summary. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

##### 1) Read

Most of the contents in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button (**1**) that reads "Click here to continue reading" to _unblur_ the next section (**2**) and continue reading.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_read.png">
  Unblur the next section by clicking on the red button when you are ready to continue
</Image>

_> Getting unstuck_

Sometimes, cache- or cookie- related issues may prevent the "Click here to continue reading" button from being generated. In this case, first try a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5 on Windows, or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac). If a hard refresh does not resolve your issue, use the "Reset blurred text button" on the left side bar. This will reset your progress for the page.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_unstuck.png">
  Use the reset button to get unstuck 
</Image>

##### 2) Answer Constructed Response Items

Some parts of the text will have constructed response items instead of the red button. These items are short written questions where you provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_cii1.png">
  You will need to answer the constructed response item first to unblur the next section
</Image>

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_cii2.png">
  Submitting an answer to the constructed response item will unlock the next section
</Image>

##### 3) Write a Summary

A summary text box is located at the bottom of each page. After you answer all constructed response items on your current page, you will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next Section. Write a summary and submit it to have it evaluated by the AI tutor.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_summary.png">
  The summary feature is disabled until you finish reading the whole page and answer all constructed response items on the page.
</Image>

_> What makes a successful summary_

A successful summary willâ€¦

- Be within 50 ~ 200 words long
- Be written in English
- Be on topic
- Not be plagiarized
- Use appropriate language

_> Evaluation_

Your summary will be evaluated by the AI engine and give it a passing or a failing grade. The evaluation will be based on four different factors:

- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Wording</span>: Whether you did a good job
  of paraphrasing words and sentences from the section and using objective
  language.
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Content</span>: Whether you included enough
  key ideas and details from the section to successfully summarize the content,
  and whether your summary focuses on the main ideas of the section and provides
  support for those ideas..
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Topic Borrowing</span>: Whether you did a
  good job of using your own language to describe the main ideas in the section.
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Topic Similarity</span>: Whether you stayed
  on topic (i.e., whether you found the main ideas of the text and focused your
  summary on those ideas).

Your summary will need to receive a passing grade on at least three out of these four factors.

_> Feedback_

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, you will be given additional attempts to revise and resubmit your summary. Click on the _Details_ tab to access more detailed feedback to help you write a better summary.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide9.png">
  Summaries that do not receive a passing grade will be given detailed feedback.
</Image>

_> Consecutive Failed Summaries

If you submit more than two failed summaries for one section, the next section will be unlocked for you to move on to. You will still be able to resubmit summaries for the failed section to try and get a passing grade.

### 3. Inline Python Sandboxes

#### Basic features

Throughout the book, there will be interactive Python environments.

They are places for you to practice writing Python code yourself. After you finish coding, you can either press Shift + Enter or click on the run button on the top to see the result of execution.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_PythonIDE_1.png">
  Click on the sandbox so it is accepting inputs from your keyboard and press Shift + Enter
</Image>

You can add more cells to the sandbox by hovering the bottom side of the sandbox and pressing the + button. Pressing the x button will remove a cell.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_PythonIDE_2.png">
  Cells can be executed separately
</Image>

Click on the Help button on the sandbox for a more visualized explanation.

#### REPL and Script Modes

If you look at the top right of the codebox, you will notice that it says REPL or script. 

In Python, a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is like a quick chat where you can type one line at a time and instantly see the result. It's great for trying out ideas on the spot. On the other hand, a script is like a letter where you write down a bunch of Python commands in a file, and you run the whole letter at once. It's better for making bigger and more organized programs. Beginners often start with the chat-like REPL for playing around and move on to writing letters (scripts) as they get more comfortable with coding. 

In this textbook, we will be using Script formatting because we wish to implement longer chunks of code.

### 4. Dashboard

#### Statistics

Access your dashboard's statistics page by clicking on your profile icon at the top right and clicking on the _Dashboard_ button.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide11.png">

</Image>

From the statistics dashboard, you can access different learning statistics such as your progress (i.e., how many sections you have completed so far), summary statistics (the number of summaries you have submitted and the number of summaries that have passed the evaluation, etc.), and daily reading time. There will also be a quick link to your recent summaries available at the bottom right corner.

#### Summaries

You will be able to access your past summaries in the summaries tab (<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) of your dashboard. Below is an overview of the Summaries pageâ€™s layout.
