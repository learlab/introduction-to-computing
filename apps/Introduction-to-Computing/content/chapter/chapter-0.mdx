## Coding Environment
This is a hands-on textbook with lots of code snippets. Throughout the book, there will be interactive Python environments.

They are places for you to practice writing Python code yourself. After you finish coding, you can click on the button on the left with three dots and click run to see the result of execution. For now, you don't have to edit anything in the editor above but to get familiar with this interface.

To execute the code below, press **Shift + Enter** or click on the button on the left bar and press the run button. 

<Notebook code = {`print("Welcome to the textbook!")`}/>

If you look at the top right of the codebox, you will notice that it says REPL or script. 

In Python, a **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is like a quick chat where you can type one line at a time and instantly see the result. It's great for trying out ideas on the spot. On the other hand, a **script** is like a letter where you write down a bunch of Python commands in a file, and you run the whole letter at once. It's better for making bigger and more organized programs. Beginners often start with the chat-like REPL for playing around and move on to writing letters (scripts) as they get more comfortable with coding.

In this textbook, we will be using Script formatting because we wish to implement longer chunks of code.
