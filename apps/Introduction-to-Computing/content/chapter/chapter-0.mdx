## Coding Environment
This is a hands-on textbook with lots of code snippets. Throughout the book, there will be interactive Python environments.

They are places for you to practice writing Python code yourself. After you finish coding, you can click on the button on the left with three dots and click run to see the result of execution. For now, you don't have to edit anything in the editor above but to get familiar with this interface.

To execute the code below, press Shift + Enter or click on the button on the left bar and press the run button.Â
